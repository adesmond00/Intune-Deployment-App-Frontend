# Product Context: Intune Deployment App Frontend

## Problem Space
Managing Intune deployments often involves complex configurations and monitoring. Existing interfaces might be cumbersome or lack the desired level of customization and responsiveness.

## Solution Vision
A modern, web-based frontend that provides an intuitive and efficient interface for interacting with Intune deployment tasks. The focus is on a clean user experience, built with modern web technologies.

## User Experience Goals
- **Intuitive Navigation:** Users should easily find the tools and information they need via a clear navigation structure (Header, Sidebar).
- **Responsive Design:** The interface should adapt well to different screen sizes.
- **Component-Based:** Building with reusable components ensures consistency and speeds up development.
- **Accessible:** The application must be usable by people with disabilities, adhering to accessibility standards.

## Why This Approach?
- **React:** A popular and powerful library for building dynamic user interfaces.
- **Tailwind CSS:** Utility-first CSS framework enables rapid styling and customization without writing extensive custom CSS.
- **Radix UI & Headless UI:** Provide the building blocks for accessible, high-quality UI components, allowing focus on application logic rather than reinventing basic UI elements. This promotes composability and modularity.
