# Project Brief: Intune Deployment App Frontend

## Core Goal
Develop a composable and modular React frontend for the Intune Deployment Application.

## Key Technologies
- React (with TypeScript)
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Radix UI for accessible UI primitives
- Headless UI for unstyled, accessible UI components

## Initial Scope
- Set up the project structure using Vite.
- Implement a basic dashboard layout featuring:
    - A persistent Header component.
    - A slide-out navigation Sidebar component (initially toggled).
    - A placeholder Dashboard page content area.

## Guiding Principles
- **Modularity:** Components should be self-contained and reusable.
- **Composability:** Build complex UIs by combining smaller components.
- **Accessibility:** Leverage Radix UI and Headless UI to ensure accessibility best practices.
- **Maintainability:** Use TypeScript and follow clear coding standards.
